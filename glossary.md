# Vocabulary #


  * Channeled ability

The greater the amount of elemental points an elf's team has, the more channeled abilities an elf has.

  * Elemental points

One of two values that monsters are assigned other than those that fall under stats.  This value shows the amount of elemental energy that will be transferred to the master controlling them.

  * Elements

All creatures in the world belong to one or more of eight basic elements.  These are:
  1. fire
  1. water
  1. plant
  1. wind
  1. ice
  1. earth
  1. electricity
  1. poison

Each element is effective and resistant to the other elements, as well as vulnerable and weak.

  * Elf

The dominant species of the world and the only playable character.  There are currently four different races of elves in the game.

  * Gambit

Creatures follow a list of commands determined by their controller/ elf.  If the first item on the list is not met, they move to the next item.  These individual items are called gambits.

  * Monsters

AKA- creatures.  These are caught and trained by elves to fight for battle, glory and treasure.  There are many types of monsters, and they are all bound to elements.  Monsters typically fight on the field as independent entities, except in certain cases, see SYMBIOTE.

  * Star point

Each elf or master has a set amount of star points.  An elf can control any type and number of creatures that he or she wishes, as long as the creature team's star value is equal or less than the elf's star points.

  * Star value

This value is based on the difficulty a master or elf has in controlling a creature.  This value is assigned to monsters only, and is an indicator of its strength and usefulness in battle.

  * Symbiote

A specific type of creature that when used by a master, attaches itself to the master rather than fight in combat directly.  These creatures do not need to be attached to a host to survive, the term symbiote is used for convenience.  These creatures are typically found hiding because when alone they are very vulnerable and very weak.

Due to the complications and difficulty with this concept, symbiotes are being left for a eventual update.

  * Team

A group of monsters under the control of an elf.  The monsters that make up this team will have the largest impact on how a player fights in the game.
