This is the project site for our own MMORPG.

This game will be based on the idea that you exist in a world where people can seek out and capture powerful creatures with specialized abilities to fight one another. You can control creatures because you also have magic, which allows you to tap into a creature's hidden powers.
Creatures under your control are more powerful than most things found in nature, and you gain the advantage of having control over these creatures.  Our game is unique because you can have multiple monsters out, all under your control.

This game is being created by a handful of college students with varying degrees with no history or training in game design.
