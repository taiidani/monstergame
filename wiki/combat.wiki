#summary A summary and explanation of how combat is handled in game.

= Introduction =

This page lists how teams are managed, how attacks work, how victory is achieved, and the result of player death.


== Team size ==

Each elf or master has a set amount of star points. An elf can control any type and number of creatures that he or she wishes, as long as the creature team's combined star value is equal or less than the elf's star points.

== Attacks ==

All attacks in the game consist of two parts, a physical based, and a element base.

To illustrate this, let us look at two very different attacks, *boulder throw* and *flare cannon*.

Boulder throw consists of the creature pulling a large rock from the ground and throw it at the opponent.  This is an earth type spell.

The spell's damage is read as 30-35 physical, and 10-12 elemental.

Because this attack is a solid object that is thrown, it is largely dependent on the casters strength.  The attack is an earth spell, so there is some elemental damage.

Flare cannon consists of the creature spitting a stream of fire. 

The spell's damage reads as 5-8 physical, and 25-45 elemental damage.   

The spell is a raging pillar of fire, primarily raw energy, with some physical force behind it.  

The physical part of spell damage is increased by the caster's strength, and the elemental damage is increased by the caster's special stat.
