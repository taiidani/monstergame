  * The row going across shows the element of the creature attacked

==Evaluations:==
*Fire*
  Effective against 2 types, resisted by 3.  Is weak to 3 types, resists 3.  Fire does not seem to have a truly amazing quality.

*Water*
  Effective against 3 types, resisted by 2.  Is weak to 2 types, resists 2.  Only fears electricity and plants, which are not that powerful.  

*Poison*
  Effective against 1 types, resisted by 2.  Is weak to 1 types, resists 2.  It is not as offensive as the others are, but very universal.  Poison is weak to the very powerful water.

*Plant*
  Effective against 2 types, resisted by 4.  Is weak to 3 types, resists 4.  It hits water hard as well as earth.  

*Wind*
  Effective against 1 types, resisted by 3.  Is weak to 0 types, resists 3.  It is not that scary, but makes that up from the fact that it fears nothing.

*Ice*
  Effective against 2 types, resisted by 1.  Is weak to 2 types, resists 1.  The two types it does fear have many weaknesses, so it great for support/ to be supported.

*Electricity*
  Effective against 1 types, resisted by 3.  Is weak to 1 types, resists 1.  Electricity only has one fear, earth, and takes down water.  

*Earth*
  Effective against 3 types, resisted by 2.  Is weak to 3 types, resists 5.  Earth is very versatile, but holds many fears.  

===Conclusion:===
Fire may need a little help, and wind may need something of a handicap, along with water.  So far, everything makes visual sense, for the most part.  We need to agree on the two questionable areas, being how wind handles ice and electric attacks.
